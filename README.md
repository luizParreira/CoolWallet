# CoolWallet

CoolWallet is a very simple app created to illustrate how to integrate Redux with React Native apps.

## Building the app

Make sure you follow the [getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) guide and install the dependencies on the `Building Projects with Native Code` guide. One thats done, just:

```
$ npm install
// For iOS users
$ react-native run-ios
// For Android users
$ react-native run-android
```
